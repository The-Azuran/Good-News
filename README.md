# Good-News
A game about preaching the truth. It's a little fun coding project using GPT code interpreter to help me script and design this game. I like how it turned out and I learned a lot.
There is an easter egg in the game but I ain't going to reveal it. I want to eventually make it more complex; keep it text based but make it so that there are neighnprhoods and locations in those neighborhoods, and people can be preached at individually.
